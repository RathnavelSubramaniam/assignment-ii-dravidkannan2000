This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

1. Sort flights to find the fastest flights
`
```{r}

arrange(flights, (arr_time - dep_time))
```
2.	Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

```{r}
select(flights, dep_time,sched_dep_time,dep_delay)



```
3.	Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
a.	A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
b.	A flight is always 10 minutes late.
c.	A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
d.	99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.

Answer:

```{r}
str(flights)
head(flights)
flight_delay_summary <- group_by(flights, flight) %>% summarise(num_flights = n(),
                                                                percentage_on_time = sum(arr_time == sched_arr_time)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_early = sum(arr_time < sched_arr_time)/num_flights, 
                                                                percentage_15_mins_early = sum(sched_arr_time - arr_time == 15)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_late = sum(arr_time > sched_arr_time)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_15_mins_late = sum(arr_time - sched_arr_time == 15)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_2_hours_late = sum(arr_time - sched_arr_time == 120)/num_flights)


```
4.	Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

Answer:

```{r}
arrange(flights,desc(arr_delay),desc(dep_delay))

	
```
5.	Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.


Answer:

```{r}
select(flights, dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, c(dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay))
flights %>% select(dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
flights %>% select_("dep_time",  "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
flights %>% select_(.dots=c("dep_time",  "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay"))
flights %>% select(dep_time:arr_delay, -c(contains("sched")))
flights %>% select(ends_with("time"),  ends_with("delay")) %>% select(-c(starts_with("sched"), starts_with("air")))

```
